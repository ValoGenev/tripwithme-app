# tripwithme-app
TripWithMe is an application thats helps people find friends to share their trip fuel cost from one direction to another.(Car Pooling)

Its backed up by another application thats running on localhost also deployed in my github called "tripwithme-bot" which has the role to scrape legally(by fb api) facebook groups for car pooling 
and turn normal bulgarian post description into objects which can be later represented in this application as entities.

The idea of the application is if you need to travel from one city to another and its hard to find a buddy to share your trip with. Just place information like (from City , to City,
Time,Seats,Price) and you will be automatically notified when someone is travling at the same time as you. And then you can simple click on his fb link and have a conversation there about more details
